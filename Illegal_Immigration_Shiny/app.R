                    but I will do my best to remain unbiased in my analysis and report only facts rather than opinions. 
                    My goal is to explore trends in US illegal immigration arrests from 2000-2016 as 
                    objectively as possible."

                    Here is a link to the original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/cbp/illegal-immigrants
                    
                    The original dataset was extremely messy so it required some cleaning before any analysis could be done. 
                    I have uploaded the 'clean' dataset as a csv file as well. It contains information on two demographics: 
                    Mexican Illegal Immigrants and All Illegal Immigrants.
                    
                    It is important to note that the numbers listed are only the illegal immigrants that were ARRESTED. 
                    This means that there were almost certainly more illegal immigrants each year that managed to enter 
                    the country unnoticed. As such I cannot claim that my analysis is an accurate representation of trends 
                    in illegal immigration overall; it only extends to illegal immigrants that were arrested.")
